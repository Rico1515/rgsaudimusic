RG'S Audimusic aims to provide the best guitars and gear online at a competitive price. We are always looking for the best products that meet the discerning taste of today’s guitarists. Whether you are a professional or a hobbyist, we have the guitars and the gear that are perfect for you. 

The term RG'S Audimusic was coined in reference to the name of it's owner "Rico Guitar'S" and combination of "Audio & Music". He has the unique ability to know which equipment will suit you as a musician at a price that is hard to resist. He did that for his friends, now he can do the same thing for you…
                                
From the time we sold our first guitar in the summer of 2020, we have not taken a break since! We started by selling surplus guitars and amplifiers. We’ve then expanded our portfolio and have gained the trust of a distinguished roster of imported guitar and gear.  We already sold branded guitar like Fender Musical Instruments Corporation,  Ibanez guitars, Aria Guitars Co. acoustic guitars and electric guitar, Hamer Guitars, Epiphone For Every Stage Guitars, Dean Guitars, Squier Guitars, Yamaha Music Foundation, Jackson/Charvel Manufacturing Inc, Morris Acoustic Guitars, Gretsch Guitars, Marshall Amps, Orange Amps – British Guitar Amps, Roland Corporation, Zoom Corportation, NUX Amplifiers - Effects, ESP & ESP LTD Guitar Company, Schecter Guitar Research, Cort Guitars and Basses | Electric Guitars, Basses & Amplifier, Guitar Pickups, Guitar parts, Guitar tools.  We have also luthier that can set up our guitars before selling.  We already supply many guitars in National Capital Region and also in Provinces Luzon, Visayas and Mindanao.
                                
Playing is one thing and pushing is another. It can be tiring… Especially if pushing is done part time and on top of our day jobs! But we are fueled by passion and by our love for guitars. Just like us, we want you to experience the joy of owning and using great gear. That keeps us moving… that keeps us pushing.
                                
In our commitment to provide the best possible guitar, we provide basic action setup. We believe that inspiration comes from the ecstasy of playing well setup instruments that is why we go to great lengths just to improve the playability of each guitar that comes out of our HQ. We are guitar players too so when know how it feels to have a well-playing instrument. That is the RG'S Audimusic guarantee.
